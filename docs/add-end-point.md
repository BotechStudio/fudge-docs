### Introduction

Fudgeâ€™s server was created using Node & Express js. By using these cutting-edge technologies, we were able to create an authentication system that allows you to protect some routes, and expose others.

This light and easy tutorial will guide you through creating a completely new server and end-point, with or without authentication.


:::note

Please navigate to the main **server** folder in your project before you start following the creation steps.

:::

### Step one

1.1 Navigate to **server > controllers**.

1.2 Create a new file that will hold the end point **logic**.

1.3 Inside the file, create an async function with the params **req** and **res**, you can find more about express routes in the express official [docs](http://expressjs.com).

```javascript
//Make sure to export the function with "exports" like so:
exports.exampleRoute = async (req, res) => {
  try {
      /* Logic goes here */
    res.status(200).send();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).send(error);
  }
}
```


### Step two

2.1 Navigate to **server > router** and create a "routes container" file.

2.2  Once in the file, make sure to import express, express router, the new route you just created, and the auth middleware if you want to create a protected route.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const controller = require('../controllers/user');
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');
const router = express.Router();
```

2.3 Connect the express router to the route you have just created and imported like the example below:

```javascript
// No auth - Public.
router.post('/example/public', controller.exampleRoute);
// With auth - Protected.
router.post('/example/protected', auth, controller.exampleRoute);

//Make sure the routers exported like below:
module.exports = router;
```

Pay attention! The first route created above is not protected. This means that any user can hit this end-point.

The second one, however, is protected. Only authenticated users can call this end-point.

### Step three

3.1 Navigate to **server > app.js**.

3.2 Import the router you just created:

```javascript
const exampleRouter = require("./routers/example");
```

3.3 Apply the router to the app with the "use" method which provided by express

```javascript
app.use(exampleRouter);
```
